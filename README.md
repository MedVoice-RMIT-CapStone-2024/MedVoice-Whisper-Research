# Whisper Installation and Usage Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of installing and using Whisper, a Python-based application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of Python.

## Installing Whisper

To install Whisper, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**: A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate. Here's how you can create one:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
```

2. **Activate the Environment**: The next step is to activate the environment. Here's how you can do it:

On Windows, run:
```bash
.\env\Scripts\activate
```

On MacOS/Linux, run:
```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

3. **Download Dependencies**: Once the environment is activated, you can download the necessary dependencies. Whisper's dependencies are listed in a file called `requirements.txt`. You can use pip, a package installer for Python, to download these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Using Whisper

To use Whisper, follow these steps:

1. **Run Whisper**: You can run Whisper using the following command:

```bash
whisper audio_file_name.filetype
```

Replace `audio_file_name.filetype` with the name and filetype of your audio file.
